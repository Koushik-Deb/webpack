npx webpack --stats detailed

4 types of Asset Modules
    1. asset/resource (large image, fonts)
    2. asset/inline (small images like svgs) - Inlines a file as a data uri. Doesn't generate a new file, instead generates a base64 representation 
    3. asset (combination of previous types) (inline if less than 8KB, else resource)
    4. asset/source (plain text data, injects as strings)

publicPath - Static files path not needed from webpack 5!
You will still need it, if you take your static files from cdn . 


Loaders

Latest JS features with BABEL ( Not Needed anymore)
      {
        test: /\.js$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: {
          loader: "babel-loader",
          options: {
            presets: ["@babel/env"],
            plugins: ["@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties"],
          },
        },
      },


plugins

Plugins are additional JavaScript libraries that do everything that loaders cannot do.
Can modify how the bundles themselves are created. Like, uglifyJSPlugin takes the bundles.js and minimizes then contents to decrease the bundle Size
